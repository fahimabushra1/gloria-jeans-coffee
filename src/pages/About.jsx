     At Gloria Jean’s Coffees, flavour is in our DNA. From that first store that was opened by Gloria Jean Kvetko in Chicago, Illinois back in 1979, to the stores in operation across 40 countries today,we’ve been on a mission to bring flavour to the world of coffee.</p>
     <h4 className="text-[#f97316]">A diverse coffee heritage</h4>
     <p>
     We believe that bringing flavour to the world starts with finding the best flavour in the world. We source our coffee beans from the world’s best coffee growing regions: Africa, Asia, and the Americas.From robust roasts to lighter delicate blends, we believe that every cup of coffee we serve should begin with unmistakable flavour on farms and forests that follow sustainable practices. That cup of coffee you love is playing its part for our forests, our climate,and the livelihoods and welfare of people around the world.</p>
     <h4 className="text-[#f97316]">Flavour is in everything we do</h4>
     <p>
     Our commitment to flavour flows through everything we blend, from our cosy hot drinks, to our Chillers and over-ice beverages. It’s baked into our delicious food items too, and perhaps most importantly, into who we are as people. Our kind of flavour means character, personality, flair. We know that when we bring our own diverse flavours to the table, we create something bigger than just coffee—we create a safe space where we can all connect and belong.</p>
